I can continue to say that I am still very much enjoying my education in the MSPA at Northwestern University. My second quarter was filled with a tremendous amount of hands on experience. The two courses I took were PREDICT 401 Intro to Statistical Analysis with Dr. Roy Sanford and PREDICT 420 Database Systems and Database Preparation with Dr. Atef Bader. Both are great professors and are invested in teaching you everything you need to know to progress to more advanced courses. I highlight some of the important lessons learned from each course below.

<h2>PREDICT 401</h2>

Concepts: Descriptive statistics, probability, distributions, statistical inference (one and two sample) used to estimate population parameters and hypothesis testing, analysis of variance, correlation, and simple regression analysis.
Language used: R
Packages frequently used: ggplot2, moments
Summary: Great foundational course for the rest of the MSPA program. You'll be able to build that statistical mindset that's important in the field of data science. The course consists of weekly discussions, quizzes every two weeks, two data analysis assignments investigating observational study on abalone, and a proctored final exam. Beside general statistical techniques like Bayes' Theorem and constructing confidence intervals, I felt some of the most important lessons I learned in this course were exploratory data analysis, correlation vs causation, and model specification.


<h2>PREDICT 420</h2>

Concepts: SQL and NoSQL databases, Python, Data preparation
Language used: Python
Packages frequently used: pandas, networkx
Summary: Heavy duty python course. Weekly assignments in the form of ipython notebooks that deal with interfacing with databases, processing the data using pandas, some work with regular expressions to search text, and general querying. There was also a quarter long group project involving picking an industry and creating a data preparation strategy. This course is very high level so you won't feel like you became an expert in databases. One of the highlights of this course involved the Enron dataset. We had to connect to MongoDB and query keywords that may indicate fraud and also do minor network analysis where we plot the relationship of email accounts.

Overall: Great quarter. I felt these two courses were very good complements. 420 implements some statistical techniques (which you'll learn in 401) such as sampling or dealing with poor data. With that said, both are worth putting all your attention into learning so taking each course one at a time is beneficial especially if you have other obligations. 

What's Next: So up until now, I have been eager to learn as much as fast as I can to become marketable during a time where big data is seeing strong demand. However, since many advanced courses have prerequisites, I'll be focused on one course in Winter 2016: PREDICT 410 Regression and Multivariate Analysis. This is a core class and one I have heard from many others to take solo. I am extremely excited to learn more, but slightly skeptical about using SAS instead of R.
