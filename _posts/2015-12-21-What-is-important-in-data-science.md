title: What's most important when it comes to data science?

As a graduate student in Predictive Analytics learning about big data, modeling and software, I find myself often measuring my ability as a newcomer to data science by how well I know Python, R, Hadoop, Spark, Statistics, Neural Networks, Random Forests, etc. You see those skills listed all over job postings and data science articles that it's hard not to fixate on them. When I first started I wanted to learn the latest and greatest tools thinking that they would automatically make me the ultimate job candidate, but as I began to learn more I started to understand that my approach to the whole thing was wrong. R and Python are tools for data analysis just like knives and spatulas are for cooking. What you cook determines what tools you might use to prepare the recipe. Sometimes a knife is the best choice and sometimes it isn't. This applies to data science as well. R/Python are popular tools that may or may not be here 5 years from now.

The focus should be on learning how to solve problems. There is a very good post by Sean McClure called "The Only Skill you Should be Concerned With" on Data Science Central here: http://www.datasciencecentral.com/m/blogpost?id=6448529:BlogPost:223808

McClure talks about how problem solving is the only skill you should focus on. The only way to get better is to simply solve many problems. Much like in cooking, you should learn to cook by cooking many different recipes. This way you learn what tools fit the job best instead of applying a single hammer for every nail approach. No one nail is created equal, so you should not only rely on one tool for the job. 

I also found a great interview with John Foreman, Chief Data Scientist at Mailchimp, who talks about what's important to learn in data science. He mentions that it can be daunting to become a data scientist because everyone feels they need to be an expert in everything based on articles online. However, his recommendation is to learn general data science skills so you can recall them when a relevant problem comes up. Here is that video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDgGg-iptYk

So some takeaways here:

* Don't focus on learning all the tools (R, Python, Scala, etc.), but focus on learning how to solve problems. The tools will come handy when you need them.
* Don't get overwhelmed by the laundry list of skills on the internet. Learn when each is useful.
* It's ok if you don't know everything.
