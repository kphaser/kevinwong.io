So it's one quarter down in the MSPA program at Northwestern University. I had some hesitations about how much I might learn in this program, but surprisingly I learned a lot! I took 3 courses this past summer. The courses were PREDICT 400 Math for Modelers (with Philip Goldfeder), PREDICT 402 Intro to Predictive Analytics (with Nethra Sambamoorthi), and PREDICT 475 Project Management (with Daniel Roth). 

<h2>Predict 400</h2>

Goldfeder is a gold standard professor. He is probably my favorite teacher so far in this program. An extremely practical and humorous guy. He is very responsive and involved on discussion boards. Anyway, this course was somewhat of a refresher for me. We mainly learned linear algebra, probability, and calculus. Python was injected into the course on the midterm and final exams where you'd have to solve for max/min problems, bayes theorem, or derivatives/integrals using Python code. I thought this was the most challenging aspect of the course and never thought about how to solve math equations using Python.

<h2>Predict 402</h2>

Sambamoorthi is a good professor. He is invested in enlightening his students and really makes an effort to explain each week's material in sync sessions. This course is enriched with lots of readings on big data, analytics case studies, dashboard design, and surveying methodologies. The assignments in this course were pretty interesting, but lengthy. Since I haven't written an essay since undergrad, it was quite a challenge to write 3 different 15-page papers throughout the quarter. Mix in creating a dashboard design, a sample proposal survey, and an analysis of the Moneyball movie starring Brad Pitt and you've got a great introduction to analytics. The course was very well structured in terms of variety of materials. The only downside was the course might have had too much reading (especially for those who were working full-time jobs).

<h2>Predict 475</h2>

I did not think I had any project management experience until I took this course. Although we had a ton of discussion topics every week, it really helped flush out the material and make the concepts relevant to our own professional experience. We learned about the overarching project life cycle.

Each week was augmentation of the project life cycle. We learned different techniques for planning, scheduling, monitoring, and closing projects. Some notable methodologies were work breakdown structure (WBS), activity-on-node diagram (AON), gantt charts, resource leveling, earned value analysis, and building on lessons learned. I can see myself applying many of these in my career when managing projects. 

We had to create a project plan (either hypothetical or related to our work). We built deliverables each week to enhance the plan based on the material we were learning. At the end of the course, we turned in a final project plan that sums up all the material we learned. It's pretty awesome when you step back to see what you got out of it all. This course is Roth's baby and he treats it with lots of care to make sure every student gets the most out of it. So far, it's been the most practical course I've taken so far!

<h2>Review</h2>

If I had to give this masters program a rating today, I'd say it's a 4/5. There is a lot to be learned that's refreshing if you really put the time and effort into it. I'm a big believer of the phrase, "you get out of it what you make of it". It's true this program does not hold your hand to teach you things like Python, but like the real world you have to be scrappy, resourceful, and keep at it. Eventually you'll realize how much you got out of it instead of focusing on how things should be.

<h2>Fall Quarter 2015</h2>

As you can probably tell by now, I'm pretty excited for the upcoming quarter. I'll be taking PREDICT 401 Statistical Analysis with Dr. Roy Sanford, as I've heard good things about him. That course will be utilizing R, which I'm already familiar with. I'll also be taking PREDICT 420 Database Systems and Data Preparation with Atef Bader. I'm also familiar with SQL, so it'll be fun and interesting to explore data management and data preparation in this course. 420 will primarily use Python (which is awesome). Definitely looking forward to what's ahead. Stay tuned!
