In my stats class, we had to do a data analysis assignment on an observational study of abalone data. Abalone are often overharvested where young abalone are not given a chance to mature so investigators wanted to learn more about abalone and see if they could predict the age of abalone. A method of determining abalone age is to count the number of rings inside the shell, however this could be tough as ring visibility is an issue. I thought it'd be a great idea to reinforce my learning by doing some data analysis on another study.
